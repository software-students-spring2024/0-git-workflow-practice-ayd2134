The URL of the article I read and found interesting:

# "It’s the End of Computer Programming as We Know It. (And I Feel Fine.)" by Farhad Manjoo

## Here is the [URL](https://nytimes.com/2023/06/02/opinion/ai-coding.html?searchResultPosition=4) of the article that I found interesting.

I found this article interesting because the author shares his own experience as a lifelong coder and as a software engineer, as well as his own insight on the emergence of artificial intelligence and its role in replacing human software engineers. The article presents a bleak outlook on the software engineering industry and its need for human employees, which personally does little to soothe my fears of finding work and experience after I graduate. However, I am interested in exploring other avenues of computer science as a career that are more involved with human interaction and human psychology, such as UX/UI design or even marketing. This article has (not so subtly) nudged me in that direction, yet I am still eager to learn more about software engineering and how AI plays such a significant role in developing software in the future.

I think this is a really interesting take about how AI is playing a role in the field of computer science. I think it will be cool to see how AI fits in with the workplace, whether it be replacing some entry level software engineers, or as a tool for all software engineers to be more productive. Overall, very cool article!

Wow Alice! Thank you so much for the interesting article and the insight. Things are looking bleak for us aspiring software engineers amidst massive tech layoffs and emergent fears of AI taking over jobs. Hopefully things get better in the future!
